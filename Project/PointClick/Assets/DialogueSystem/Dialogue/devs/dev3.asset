    myText: Okay you hit the orc with your sword.  Then you hit it again.  It's almost
      dead.  Fighters can use an ability to get an extra action on their turn once
      per day... Alright, you're using that.  The orc is dead.  The orc would then
      attack, but it's dead.  So is the other one that would attack.  Okay, Rouge,
      your turn.

    myText: Am I in a position to get sneak attack?  Oh, wait, nevermind.  I flank
      and sneak attack the last orc... Damn, I rolled a 1 to hit.  Oh! I'll try again
      with my offhand dagger.  20!

      don't do much damage.  The orc attacks you back... but it misses.  Druid!

      have a good week.  Reminder we are starting a new campaign again next week
      where I will try to keep you at a decent power level only to probably fail
      again due to the innate nature of the system.
