    myText: Of course you can, my groovy friend.  You'll need to meet our requirements,
      though.  You'll need a ticket.  I can also sense you've got the groovy vibes,
      but have you got the groovy style?  We also do a small quiz on our past groovy
      winners, so study up my friend.

    myText: But I can sense your need to experience the vibes, so if you can meet
      our requirments, I'll let you join me as today's judge.  I'll give you a prize
      for helping out, too.  The key to all the guest rooms.  I guess you could call
      it a skeleton key, ha!
